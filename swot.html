                <h3>Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats</h3>
                <p>A SWOT analysis provided a structured framework to evaluate and leverage internal and external factors that impact strategic decision-making.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Competitive differentiation:</strong> Pilot prides itself on exceptional service and values digital offerings as a way to ensure an efficient, engaged visit experience for Pilot customers. Digital business tools, APIs, and several front-end UIs provide access to offerings such as online ordering, pay-at-the pump, parking and shower reservations, merchandise checkout, and more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wide network of locations and offerings:</strong> Over 750 retail locations under multiple brands, each provides diesel fuel, 1-5 QSR brands, merchandise, bathrooms, showers, and wi-fi services, at minimum. Many offer additional amenities, such as roadside assistance, health clinics, and truck washes, to serve OTR truck and auto drivers in their journeys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry leadership:</strong> As North America's largest travel center network, Pilot Flying J has a broad customer base to engage with, making the impact of a successful loyalty program potentially significant.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complex tech ecosystem:</strong> With the many disparate systems in place to support fueling, retail, hospitality, amenities, and corporate monitoring systems to monitor, the complexitities could impact project success.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public image:</strong> Customer trust may be impacted due to recent fraud investigations and layoffs, making a loyalty program harder to sell to skeptical consumers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Leveraging data for personalization:</strong> Prior-year API enablement and mobile app redesign projects supported integration, which opens opportunity for high-level personalized customer engagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tech-savvy customer base and workforce:</strong> With heavy app usage, the customer base may be receptive to further tech-driven loyalty solutions. An innovative, motivated workforce can contribute to the success of the project.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Threats</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Declining loyalty/increased competition:</strong> As Pilot acquisitions and competitor footprints grew, Pilot saw a decrease in recurring revenue from returning customers, impacting customer lifetime value (LTV).</li>
                    <li><strong>Miles-per-gallon improvements:</strong> As vehicles become more fuel-efficient, consumers stop less frequently, impacting repeat business.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rapid distribution expansion:</strong> Distribution centers are closer together than ever before, meaning fewer opportunities for OTR drivers to become repeat customers.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
