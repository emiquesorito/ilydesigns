    <h1>App Feature Additions at JTV</h1>
    <p>At JTV, our goal was to revolutionize the online shopping experience for jewelry enthusiasts. Recognizing the importance of customer engagement and satisfaction, we embarked on a journey to introduce innovative app features that not only catered to our users' needs but also set new standards in the e-commerce space.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Try-On</h2>
    <p>In the pursuit of enhancing the online shopping experience, we identified a gap: the inability for customers to visualize how jewelry would look on them before making a purchase. Collaborating with the web product owner, we delved into augmented reality (AR) technology, launching a virtual try-on feature that allowed customers to preview jewelry pieces using their smartphone or computer cameras. This initiative not only decreased return rates but also significantly boosted conversion rates and customer engagement, marking a pivotal step in our journey to redefine online jewelry shopping.</p>

    <h2>Custom Jewelry Design Tool</h2>
    <p>Understanding our customers' desire for personalized and unique jewelry, we explored the development of a custom jewelry design tool. This feature empowered customers to design their pieces, choosing from a variety of metals, settings, and gemstones. Although the project came to fruition after my tenure, its impact was clear: it heightened customer engagement, increased cart conversions, and elevated the average order value, thanks to the perceived uniqueness and personal value of customized products.</p>

    <h2>Enhanced Search and Filter Options</h2>
    <p>To streamline the product discovery process, we revamped our OTT app's search functionality, integrating advanced filters like designer, show host, series title, and jewelry category. This enhancement not only facilitated a more efficient search experience for our customers but also directly contributed to increased viewer engagement and sales, as users could now easily find shows and merchandise that aligned with their interests.</p>

    <p>Through these initiatives, we significantly elevated JTV's digital presence, creating a more engaging, personalized, and user-friendly shopping experience. Each feature addition was a step towards not just meeting but exceeding our customers' expectations, driving remarkable growth in engagement and sales.</p>
