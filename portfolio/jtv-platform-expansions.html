    <h1>Platform Expansion Projects at JTV</h1>
    <p>In an era where the digital landscape is constantly evolving, JTV recognized the need to expand its reach and adapt to the changing consumption patterns of our audience. Our mission was clear: to make JTV's unique shopping experience more accessible by embracing new digital platforms and enhancing our app's performance and security.</p>

    <h2>Jedora.com Launch</h2>
    <p>The launch of Jedora.com was a milestone project aimed at broadening our digital footprint. My role involved rigorously testing the interactive educational section and user journeys to ensure a seamless customer experience from the outset. The integration of the Paypal Pay-In-4 feature further exemplified our commitment to customer convenience, allowing flexible payment options and ensuring Jedora.com's launch was met with enthusiasm and success.</p>

    <h2>Expansion to LG & Samsung Smart TVs</h2>
    <p>Recognizing the shift towards smart TV platforms, I spearheaded the expansion of the JTV Live app to LG and Samsung TVs. This strategic move was informed by detailed user research and aimed to cater to our audience's preferences for simplicity and convenience. By tapping into the significant market share of these platforms, we not only increased our reach but also achieved remarkable sales growth in our OTT channels.</p>

Each project, from the Jedora.com launch to app performance optimizations, was a testament to our proactive approach to digital transformation and our unwavering focus on customer satisfaction and trust.</p>
